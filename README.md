# LinkedIn-Downloader
LinkedIn DL  is a small GUI program codded with Python and based on my previous Lynda Download script.
LinkedIn GUI version is capable to download mutliple courses from LinkedIn Learning by a given list. The features implemented in this beta version are:

Completed:
- Automatic Login to LinkedIn
- Enabling/Disabling Chrome extensinons 
- Change Browser Agent
- Select Downloading Folder
- Add Courses List
- Working in Background and Windowed
- Option to save credentials from the browser, so after the first successfull login if this option is selected the program will use the session.

TODO Next:
 - Proxy functionality and/or VPN
 - Improving the overal GUI look
 - Adding An Advanced Options Menu wich will include speccific sleep times to control the software behaviour more precisely
 - Capability to download Exercise Files (That was included in my LyndaDl script but not here)
 - Capability to download Transcripts 
 - Capability to separate the videos in chapters, so each chapters will have a particular folder with videos inside the course folder
 - Capability to choose the video quality before starting the program
 
 If you have any advice, recomends or ideas for additional functionalities they are very wellcome.
